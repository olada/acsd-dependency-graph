# About this project
This module visualizes attributes which were previously stored in the
neo4j graph database. This visualization is necessary because the
shipped browser from neo4j's webapp does not have a decent
representation but lacks a decent layout (e.g. 20 nodes are just
shown on top of each other)

This module is a Spring MVC Web application which leverages D3 for a
decent graph output.
